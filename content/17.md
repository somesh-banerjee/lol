## Trust in today's Internet

The Internet is a vast and complex network of interconnected computers, servers, and devices that allows us to communicate, share information, and access services from anywhere in the world. It has revolutionized the way we live, work, and play, and has become an essential part of our daily lives.

However, the Internet is not without its risks. Cybercrime, data breaches, and privacy violations are all too common, and can have serious consequences for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. As a result, trust in the Internet is eroding, and many people are becoming increasingly wary of sharing their personal information online.

Apart from the privacy concerns, there are also concerns regarding the authenticity of the information available on the Internet. With the rise of fake news, misinformation, and disinformation, it can be difficult to know what to believe and who to trust. This can have serious consequences for democracy, public health, and social cohesion.

Any digital solution that involves submitting personal information like IDs or other documents, always go through a offline verification process. This is to ensure that the information is authentic and the person submitting the information is who they claim to be. Though we are saying, We are getting digital, but we are still relying on offline verification process to ensure the authenticity of the information.

### Existing solutions and their limitations

1. The most basic way to identify a person online is through the use of usernames and passwords. However, this method is not very secure, as passwords can be easily guessed or stolen, and usernames can be impersonated. Also users tend to use the same password for multiple accounts, which makes it unsecure, since if one account is compromised, all the accounts are compromised.

2. To solve the problem of many passwords, Identity providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. have come up with the concept of Single Sign On (SSO). This allows users to use their existing accounts to sign in to other websites and services. However, this also has its limitations, as it can create a single point of failure, and can give the identity provider access to a lot of personal information. They can track the user's activity across multiple websites and services, which can be a privacy concern. Also, if the identity provider is compromised, all the accounts linked to it are compromised.

3. Correlation of data across multiple websites and services can be used to identify a person. This can be done by tracking the user's activity across multiple websites and services, and correlating the data to create a unique identifier for the user. This can be a privacy concern, as it can be used to track the user's activity across multiple websites and services without their knowledge or consent.

4. All the above methods are based on storing the user's personal information in a centralized database. This can be a security concern, as it creates a single point of failure, and can be a target for hackers. Also, the user has to trust the identity provider to keep their personal information secure and private.

5. Storing in a centralized database also creates a privacy concern, as the identity provider has access to a lot of personal information about the user. They can track the user's activity across multiple websites and services, and can use the data for targeted advertising, profiling, and other purposes.

So, how can we restore trust in today's Internet? There are no easy answers, but there are steps that we can take to make the Internet a safer and more secure place for everyone.

## How to restore trust in today's Internet

### Verifiable credentials

One way to restore trust in today's Internet is through the use of verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are a way to prove who you are online, without revealing any unnecessary personal information. They are based on the principle of minimal disclosure, which means that you only reveal the information that is necessary to prove your identity, and nothing more.

Verifiable credentials are cryptographically signed by the issuer, and can be verified by anyone using the public key of the issuer. This makes them tamper-proof and secure, and ensures that the information they contain is authentic and trustworthy.

Verifiable credentials resolve the trust issue related to the authenticity of the information. But the problem moves to the issuer of the credential. How can we trust the issuer of the credential? If the issuer is compromised, all the credentials issued by the issuer are compromised.

### Self-sovereign identity

Another way to restore trust in today's Internet is through the use of self-sovereign identity. Self-sovereign identity is a way for individuals to own and control their own digital identity, without relying on a centralized authority. It is based on the principles of user-centricity, privacy, and security, and gives individuals the power to manage their own identity and personal information.

### Decentralized identity

Decentralized identity is a new paradigm that is emerging in the field of digital identity. It is based on the principles of self-sovereign identity, and uses blockchain technology to create a secure and tamper-proof identity system. Decentralized identity gives individuals the power to own and control their own digital identity, and eliminates the need for centralized authorities and identity providers.

DIDs are a new type of identifier similar to URLs. They are unique, uniform, highly available, and cryptographically verifiable. We can use DID Resolver to resolve the DID to get the DID Document. The DID Document contains the public key of the DID. We can use the public key to send encrypted messages to the DID. Just by responding to the encrypted message, the DID can prove that they own the private key corresponding to the public key in the DID Document.
This DIDs are stored in a decentralized network and are not vulnerable to a single point of failure.

#### Public and private DIDs

Public DIDs are stored on a public ledger. They are globally discoverable and resolvable. They are used for public interactions and are used to establish trust with strangers.

Private DIDs are not stored on a public ledger. They are used for private interactions and are used to establish trust with known entities. Private DIDs save resources and costs, as they do not need to be stored on a public ledger. Moreover, they provide privacy and security, as they are not globally discoverable.

### Wallets

Wallets are used to store and manage verifiable credentials and DIDs. They are secure, tamper-proof, and easy to use. Wallets can be used to store and manage multiple verifiable credentials and DIDs, and can be used to prove your identity online without revealing any unnecessary personal information.

### Trust Over IP

Trust Over IP is a new initiative that aims to create a global standard for digital trust. It is based on the principles of verifiable credentials, self-sovereign identity, and decentralized identity, and aims to create a secure and trustworthy Internet for everyone. Trust Over IP is an open, inclusive, and collaborative initiative that is supported by a wide range of organizations and individuals from around the world. You can learn more about Trust Over IP at [trustoverip.org](https://trustoverip.org).
I will skip the details of Trust Over IP, as it is explained in detail in the interactive content available [here](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/). You should explore the interactive content to learn more about Trust Over IP.

## SSI using Hyperledger

Hyperledger provides a set of tools and frameworks that can be used to implement self-sovereign identity solutions. Hyperledger Indy is the first project to provide a decentralized identity solution. It became a part of Hyperledger in 2017. Indy was initially a all in one solution for decentralized identity, but later it was split into multiple projects. Today, Indy mainly consists of the ledger and tools to interact with the ledger.

Hyperledger Ursa, is one of the projects that was split from Indy. Ursa is basically the crypto repository of Hyperledger Indy. In 2018, Ursa was split from Indy to provide a common repository for cryptographic code that can be used across multiple Hyperledger projects. Ursa provides a set of cryptographic libraries that can be used to implement secure and tamper-proof digital identity solutions. It can be used in other Hyperledger projects like Indy, Aries, etc.

Hyperledger Anoncreds is another extracted project from Indy in 2022 that provides a set of tools and libraries for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials using zero-knowledge proofs. By separating Anoncreds from Indy, it can be used in other non-Indy projects as well.

Hyperledger Aries is another project that was split from Indy in 2019. Aries is the agent framework for Hyperledger Indy. Aries was built as a separate project to provide a common agent framework that can be used across multiple ledger systems other than Indy and can also work with other verifiable credential systems other than Anoncreds. The core of Aries is the agent-to-agent messaging protocol that allows agents to communicate with each other in a secure and private way.

Togetehr, Indy, Ursa, Anoncreds, and Aries provide a complete set of tools and frameworks that can be used to implement self-sovereign identity solutions using Hyperledger.

### Hyperledger Indy and Sovrin

Sovrin is a global public utility for self-sovereign identity. It is built on top of Hyperledger Indy and provides a decentralized identity solution that is secure, private, and tamper-proof. Sovrin is a global public utility that is governed by the Sovrin Foundation, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting digital trust and privacy.

Sovrin provides a set of tools and frameworks that can be used to implement self-sovereign identity solutions. It is based on the principles of verifiable credentials, self-sovereign identity, and decentralized identity, and aims to create a secure and trustworthy Internet for everyone.

### What is stored on the ledger?

We have discussed that no personal information is stored on the ledger. But what is actually stored on the ledger so that the verifier can verify the credential without contacting the issuer?

The ledger stores the following information:

1. **Public DIDs**: Public DIDs are stored on the ledger. They are globally discoverable and resolvable. They are used to establish trust with strangers.

2. **Schema**: Schemas are stored on the ledger. They define the structure of the verifiable credentials. They contain the names and types of the attributes that are included in the verifiable credentials. Schemas can be created by the issuer or can be reused from the public schemas.

3. **Credential Definition**: Credential definitions are stored on the ledger. They contain the public key of the issuer that is used to sign the verifiable credentials. They are used to verify the authenticity of the verifiable credentials.

4. **Revocation Registry**: Revocation registries are stored on the ledger. They contain the list of revoked verifiable credentials. They are used to check if the verifiable credential has been revoked by the issuer. This is a optional feature and can be used by the issuer if they want to revoke the verifiable credentials.
